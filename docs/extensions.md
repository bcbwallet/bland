# Extensions

Bland has partial support for Chrome extensions (see [#21](https://github.com/sentialx/electron-extensions/issues/21)).

# Installing an extension

To install an extension, you will need to extract the extension and put the extracted folder to `extensions` directory.

The `extensions` directory paths:
- On Linux and macOS: `~/.bland/extensions`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/bland/extensions`
